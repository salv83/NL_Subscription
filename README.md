# Tasks:

1 . Create a shortcode for a newsletter subscription input form with a mobile friendly submit
button. The default bgcolor of the button is #333. Place the shortcode on an example page
or post with a #fff background as well as in the global footer (which has a dark #333
background). 
Make sure the button is fully visible in both cases in case this short code is used twice on 
the viewed page (in the content of the current page & in the footer), it should not interfere 
with itself in functionality or style

2 . Add 2 mandatory input fields to the checkout page:
Birthday
Gender
(m/f/x)
Check on input if:
the fields got filled correctly
the person filling the form is above 18 years old
deny continuing the purchase for all people younger than 18 years
Also make sure that the fields integrate seamlessly into the default design of storefront
and are fully responsive down to a iPhone 5S
